GIFPlayer
=========

**"The future in GIF technology."**

GIFPlayer is a JavaScript library for reading GIF images and rendering GIF animations in the browser using canvas. Contrary to other GIF parsers and LZW decoders in JavaScript, GIFPlayer uses typed arrays for improved performance.

This project is partially based on [jsgif](http://slbkbs.org/jsgif/) by [shachaf](https://github.com/shachaf).
